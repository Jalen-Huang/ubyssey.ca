          <p>While the title of this year’s magazine is more than a little tongue-in-cheek, the subject matter is serious.
          The climate crisis is quickly becoming one of the defining issues of our time, and its importance will only continue 
          to grow as its impacts become more severe and are felt in more places. It is a problem that political scientists love 
          to call “super wicked” and that’s how it feels so much of the time, like something so big and complex that there’s nothing 
          we as individuals can do. We think that’s part of where our tendency to make light of it comes from. When we joke 
          about something it gives us a semblance of control. We hope that by seeing a different side of the crisis and hearing about 
          the ways — big and small — that people and institutions are trying to make change, you will be inspired to act, whether that 
          means changing your consumption or just signing a petition. Because at the end of the day, no matter how cheeky our discussion 
          of the crisis is, it is here and happening now. And even if you’re not a policy-maker or a politician, we all need to have our eyes 
          wide open when it comes to where our planet is headed.
